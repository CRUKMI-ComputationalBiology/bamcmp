Please install htslib (http://www.htslib.org) before you run make
in the bamcmp folder to create the bamcmp executable located in the
build folder. The executable is relocatable once successfully
compiled.

The default location for htslib is /usr/local. Especially in
Red Hat based distributions /usr/local is not a default path
for libraries. Hence, you have to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to set
the right library path for  bamcmp. Please add the following
line to your $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.bash_profile

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib

Please source the $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.bash_profile file after
you have made the changes.

E.g.:

source ~/.bashrc

### If htslib isn't installed in a standard location

Please set the environment variable $HTSLIBDIR to the proper folder
before running make, if the htslib is not installed in the standard
location and adapt your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly.

E.g.

export HTSLIBDIR=/nonstandard/htslib
cd bamcmp/
make

Add the following line to you $HOME/.bashrc:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/nonstandard/htslib/lib

(/nonstandard/htslib must contain the include/ and the lib folder)
